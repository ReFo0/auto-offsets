# Auto Offsets Update for External Cheats

This project is created to provide automatically updating offsets for external cheats.

## Overview

This project is designed to automatically update offsets used by external cheat software. Offsets are crucial data locations that help cheat software target the correct memory addresses in specific versions of games.

## Downloading Offsets

The `download_offsetjson` function in the project downloads the latest offsets from a specific URL and saves them locally on the user's machine.
